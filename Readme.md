AutoSynth - a Customizable Synthetic Data Generator for Machine Learning
Objective:
Build a Python tool that can automatically generate synthetic datasets for various machine learning tasks (e.g., image, text, tabular data). The tool should allow users to define parameters such as noise, imbalance, feature dependencies, and augmentation strategies, which makes it highly customizable.

Feature Plan:
1. Data Type Flexibility:

Include support for generating tabular, text, and image datasets. Each data type will have different generation mechanisms (e.g., using GPT-like models for text, random feature combinatorics for tabular data, GANs for image data).

2. Data Augmentation:
Implement a data augmentation pipeline for each data type. For images, use techniques like rotation, cropping, and GAN-based generation. For text, use NLP techniques like back-translation or paraphrasing.

3. Customizability:

Users should be able to define distribution rules for their synthetic datasets (e.g., define correlations between features in tabular data, or ensure text follows a certain structure).

4. Class Imbalance Support:

Incorporate mechanisms for simulating imbalanced datasets, making it useful for training ML models that need to handle class imbalance.

5. API Design:

Provide a clean API with simple commands, allowing users to integrate this tool into their ML pipelines or experiments with ease. The API should be extendable for developers who want to add more data types or transformations.

6. Visualization & Reporting:

Automatically generate reports and visualizations (e.g., data distributions, correlations) to help users understand the characteristics of the generated data.

7. Integration with ML Libraries:

The tool can integrate with popular ML libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, allowing for seamless experimentation.
